Python Lists
 
Lists are the most 
versatile of Python's compound data types. A list contains items 
separated by commas and enclosed within square brackets ([]). To some extent, lists 
are similar to arrays in C. One difference between them is that all the items belonging 
to a list can be of
 
different data type.
 
The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice operator (
[ ] and [
:
]
) with 
indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the list and working their way to end 
-
1. The 
plus (
+
) sign is the list concatenation operator, an
d the asterisk (
*
) is the repetition 
operator. For example:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
list 
=
 
[
 
'abcd'
,
 
786
 
,
 
2.23
,
 
'john'
,
 
70.2
 
]
 
tinylist 
=
 
[
123
,
 
'john'
]
 
 
print
 
list          
# Prints complete list
 
print
 
list
[
0
]
       
# Prints first element of the list
 
print
 
list
[
1
:
3
]
     
# Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
 
print
 
list
[
2
:]
      
# Prints elements starting from 3rd element
 
print
 
tinylist 
*
 
2
  
# Prints list two times
 
print
 
list 
+
 
tinylist 
# Prints concatenated lists
 
This 
produce
s
 
the following result:
 
[
'abcd'
,
 
786
,
 
2.23
,
 
'john'
,
 
70.200000000000003
]
 
abcd
 
[
786
,
 
2.23
]
 
[
2.23
,
 
'john'
,
 
70.200000000000003
]
 
[
123
,
 
'john'
,
 
123
,
 
'john'
]
