Assertions in Python
 
An assertion is a sanity
-
check that you can turn on 
or turn off when you are done 
with your testing of the program.
 
The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a
 
raise
-
if
 
statement (or to be 
more accurate, a raise
-
if
-
not statement). An expression is tested, and if the result 
comes up false, 
an exception is raised.
 
Assertions are carried out by the assert statement, the newest keyword to Python, 
introduced in version 1.5.
 
Programmers often place assertions at the start of a function to check for valid input, 
and after a function call to check 
for valid output.
 
The
 
assert
 
Statement
 
When it encounters an assert statement, Python evaluates the accompanying 
expression, which is hopefully true. If the expression is false, Python raises 
an
 
AssertionError exception
.
 
The syntax for assert is:
 
assert
 
Expression
[,
 
Arguments
]
 
If the assertion fails, Python uses ArgumentExpression as the argument for the 
AssertionError. AssertionError exceptions can be caught and handled like any other 
exception using the try
-
except statement, but if not handled, they wil
l terminate the 
program and produce a traceback.
 
Example
 
Here is a function that converts a temperature from degrees Kelvin to degrees 
Fahrenheit. Since zero degrees Kelvin is as cold as it gets, the function bails out if it 
sees a negative temperature:
 
#!/usr/bin/python
 
 
def
 
KelvinToFahrenheit
(
Temperature
):
