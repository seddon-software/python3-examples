Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently
, 
but with the following benefits:
 

 
Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main 
thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other 
more easily than if they were separate processes.
 

 
Threads sometimes 
called light
-
weight processes and they do not require much 
memory overhead; they care cheaper than processes.
 
A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an 
instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it i
s currently running.
 

 
It can be pre
-
empted (interrupted)
 

 
It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads 
are running 
-
 
this is called yielding.
 
Starting a New Thread
 
To spawn another thread, you need to call following method 
available 
in
 
thread
 
module:
 
thread
.
start_new_thread 
(
 
function
,
 
args
[,
 
kwargs
]
 
)
 
This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux 
and Windows.
 
The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls 
function 
with the passed list of
 
agrs
. When function returns, the thread terminates.
 
Here,
 
args
 
is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing 
any arguments.
 
kwargs
 
is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.
 
Example
