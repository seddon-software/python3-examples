The Python standard for database interfaces is the 
Python DB
-
API. Most Python 
database interfaces adhere to this standard.
 
You can choose the right database for your application. Python Database API supports 
a wide range of database servers
 
such as
:
 

 
GadFly
 

 
mSQL
 

 
MySQL
 

 
PostgreSQL
 

 
Microsoft SQL Server 2000
 

 
Informix
 

 
Interbase
 

 
Oracle
 

 
Sybase
 
Here is the list of available Python database interfaces:
 
Python Database Interfaces and 
APIs
 
.You must download a separate DB API module for each 
database you need to 
access. For example, if you need to access an Oracle database as well as a MySQL 
database, you must download both the Oracle and the MySQL database modules.
 
The DB API provides a minimal standard for working with databases using Python
 
structures and syntax wherever possible. This API includes the following:
 

 
Importing the API module.
 

 
Acquiring a connection with the database.
 

 
Issuing SQL statements and stored procedures.
 

 
Closing the connection
 
We would learn all the concepts using MySQL,
 
so let
 
u
s talk about MySQLdb module
.
 
What is MySQLdb?
 
MySQLdb is an interface for connecting to a MySQL database server from Python. It 
implements the Python Database API v2.0 and is built on top of the MySQL C API.
